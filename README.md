- I consume a copious amount of beetles. Don't ask me about this I will kill you.
- I have insane hemmerhoids and I mean INSANE. I will attack you to cope.
- I have every mental illness.
- You will begin to cough in three days.
- My spine sheds every two weeks.
- I make myself known by knocking thrice upon your ceiling. Nothing less, nothing more. Thrice on the ceiling, thrice on the door.
